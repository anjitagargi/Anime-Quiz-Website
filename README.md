# Live Demo

***Take a look on the live version here:*** https://anime-quiz-zone.netlify.app/


# Technology Used

I have built this project using the following tools & techniques:
- React.JS
- Typescript.
- Context API
- Compound Components.
- JSX.
- CSS Modules.
- VSCode.


# How To Use

To be able to use this react app locally in a development environment you will need the following:

1) You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer.

2) Then From your terminal, you should do the following:

```cmd
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/anjitagargi/Anime-Quiz-Zone

# Go into the repository
cd react-Quiz-App

# Install dependencies
npm install 

# Run the app
npm start

```

4) Now you can see the project in your browser as you see in the live demo link. 
Happy Hacking!

`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
